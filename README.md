# A Web Scrapper for Calculating CGPA of CUET Students


CUET is publishing every course result in the students portal.Where I found it very tedius to calculate cgpa using pen and paper method and must say, it's a time consuming method. So, I try to automate this by building a web-scrapper in JavaScript. Where the students have to just copy  the code fro scrapper.js and paste it in the browser console. But before that, the student must login into their portal and head over to the ``https://course.cuet.ac.bd/result_published.php`` page. After running the code in browser console, students can see their calculated cgpa.

Steps are as follows:-

* Open your terminal and run 
```bash 
 git clone https://github.com/sahasourav17/CalcCGPA-CUET-Students-Portal.git
 cd CalcCGPA-CUET-Students-Portal
``` 
* Open the ``scrapper.js`` file and copy the code.

* Login to your student portal and head over to the ``Published Result`` page.
* Right Click on the page and Select inspect option.
* In ``console`` just paste the previously copied code.
* Boom!! It will show your CGPA less than a Second.

**NOTE**
- Must choose 100 records per page.
